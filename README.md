The backend for a simple supply management system. You can create products with a EAN (European Article Number) and change the amount of the product (with expiration dates).

## Why this project?

I am creating this project for my father, who is developing a supply management system to manage our supplies.
This application will make it possible to save the data online and manage users.
It will function as the part of the projects that contains the logic not directly seen by the user and take the load of the client.

## What I learned so far?

- I learned that a crucial part of developing a application isnÂ´t just programming, but designing and planning the a. o. API endpoints and desired behavior of the application.
- I learned that testing is a necessary and very useful step in developing a feature. I beleve that - after I got the hang of the test framework - the testing saved more time than writing the tests.

## What is used?

Routes / Middleware: Express Js

Types: typescript

Testing: jest

Database: MongoDB / mongoose

Validation: Joi

Error Handling: Custom Errors

Auth: jsonwebtoken

Documentation: Swagger (to be implemented)

## Routes

#### Auth

```
POST /auth/login
DELETE /auth/logout

POST /auth/users
PUT /auth/users/:id
DELETE /auth/users/:id
```

### Products

All these routes are only accessible for logged in users and only the products of the specific user can be accessed.

```
GET /products
GET /products/:ean
POST /products
PUT /products/:ean
DELETE /products/:ean
```

## Auth

JsonWebTokens are used for authentication and authorisation of users.
To log in get the accessToken (expires in 30m) from this route: POST /auth/login.
Now you can access the products by adding the token in the header:
```
"authorisation": "bearer [accessToken]"
```

## What is next?

- Email verification
- Reorganizing file structure
- Splitting the logic in productsRoutes into smaller portions
- Tests for productsRoutes and authRoutes
- Integration tests with the aatabase
- End to End tests
- Swagger documentation
- Check if using refreshTokens is necessery / sensible
- Implement logging
- Implement a CI/CD pipeline using Github Actions

## How to use the application locally?

First make sure to install docker.

Add a .env file in the root dir and these environment variables:
```
PORT=3060
MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongodb:27017/supply-manager-db
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=yourAccessTokenSecret
```

Execute this command to build the images of the database and application and run them:

```
docker-compose up
```
